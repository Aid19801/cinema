# cinema-app

This project was created for the Sky Apprentice Bootcamp in April 2017.

The group were tasked with building a cinema/video player app from scratch.

They chose to use CSS, Jquery, Node JS & MySQQL as a tech stack.

The final version was presented as part of the Grad/Academy Presentations of 2017.
